# What is this
This is a small project to get into C++ for the first time.
I'm trying to create a small text-based game where you walk through different locations and biomes and fight off enemies.

## Modding
I'm trying to make this game moddable because I always like it when you change a game in its behavior. 
This is mostly achieved by loading the biomes in the form of JSON files at game startup.

If I get to it, maybe I'll add a way to inject a DLL of some sort into the game for custom code.

## How to setup
#### 1. Clone the project<br>
```git clone "https://github.com/JustusWalter-Helk/fluffy-spork.git" --recursive```
#### 2. Generate the VS Solution
Go into ```/Scripts``` and choose the appropriate setup file for your OS.
#### 3. Open in Visual Studio
Open the newly generated ```Fluffy Spork.sln``` solution in the root directory.
#### 4. Run the project
Under your configurations choose ```Dist``` and press run.


Have fun!
